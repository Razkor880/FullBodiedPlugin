# SKSE "Full Bodied Animations"

Plugin to allow advanced functions for Full Bodied Animations


Repository so far contains an animation event listener.

This is also my first time using GitHub! Message me here or on Discord if anything isn't working or if you have any feedback. I am planning on eventually opening this to public.
