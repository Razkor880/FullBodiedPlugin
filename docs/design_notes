# Full Bodied Animation – Design Notes

This document captures provisional ideas, experiments, constraints, and decisions that have not yet hardened into canonical architecture.

Anything here may change or be discarded.

---

REFERENCE MATERIAL

Legacy mods and prior work may be consulted for understanding existing behavior or pitfalls, but their architectures are not treated as templates.

This project intentionally favors modern, explicit, and maintainable approaches.

---

GUIDING CONSTRAINTS

* Default to CommonLibSSE-NG
* Prefer configuration-driven systems initially
* Support annotation-driven input long-term using the same pipeline
* Avoid hidden coupling between modules

---

THINGS WE EXPLICITLY DO NOT WANT

* Silent magic numbers
* Animation-specific hardcoding in SKSE logic
* Heavy Papyrus logic
* Global state without clear ownership
* Feature creep without architectural justification

---

KNOWN AREAS OF FRICTION

* Behavior graph timing semantics
* Paired animation role resolution
* Skeleton differences and node inheritance
* Visibility without collapsing child nodes

These are candidates for refactors or abstraction layers.

---

EXPERIMENTS AND OPEN IDEAS

* Unified grammar for scale, visibility, and morph events
* Coexistence of INI timelines and annotations
* Stateless versus stateful effect application
* Declarative event descriptions versus imperative logic

---

REFACTOR TRIGGERS

Propose a refactor when:

* The same workaround appears more than twice
* A module accumulates unrelated responsibilities
* Debugging requires cross-module knowledge

---

GPT COLLABORATION RULES

* Propose alternatives proactively
* Never apply changes without approval
* Always disclose what would change
* Treat this file as safe space for speculation

---

OPEN QUESTIONS

* Where should long-lived actor state live?
* How much responsibility should behavior graphs carry?
* When does flexibility turn into ambiguity?
