YourAssignment – Tween Refactor (Revised Canon for Executor)

Refactor Checklist:
Phase 0: Baseline safety

0.1 Ensure the project builds clean on main as-is.
0.2 Run one quick in-game smoke test:

Trigger FBEvent once

Confirm existing instant behavior still works (scales and/or morphs)

Checkpoint A:
Build succeeds. Baseline behavior unchanged.

Phase 1: Inventory and touch-point mapping (no behavior changes)

1.1 Identify and document the exact structs and functions involved in:

TimedCommand definition and usage

FBConfig parsing path for morph commands

ActorManager start / cancel / reset paths

FBMorph delta application and reset paths

AnimationEvents legacy parsing path to be migrated

1.2 Add small, explicit TODO/TweenRefactor comments at key entry points for audit visibility.

Checkpoint B:
Build succeeds. No runtime behavior changes.

Phase 2: Data model extension (compile-only)

2.1 Extend FB::TimedCommand with:

float tweenSeconds = 0.0

tweenCurve identifier (default linear)

2.2 Ensure all constructors, initializers, and users of TimedCommand compile without behavior changes.

2.3 Ensure any logging or debug output still compiles.

Checkpoint C:
Build succeeds. Behavior unchanged (tweenSeconds defaults to 0).

Phase 3: FBConfig parsing extension (parse-only)

3.1 Extend morph command parsing to optionally read tween fields.

3.2 Default tweenSeconds to 0.0 when absent.

3.3 Strict INI behavior:

Malformed tween syntax rejects the command/section per existing strict rules.

3.4 Non-strict INI behavior:

Log and ignore malformed tween fields.

Preserve the base command when valid.

3.5 Add debug logging when a tween is parsed:

Timeline

Role

Morph key

Delta

tweenSeconds

Curve

Checkpoint D:
Build succeeds. Existing INI files load unchanged.
Optional check: logs show tween parsing, but behavior is still instant.

Phase 4: Game-thread pump scaffolding (no timeline changes yet)

4.1 Add a small self-rescheduling update pump using SKSE TaskInterface:

StartPump()

PumpOnce()

Optional StopPump()

4.2 PumpOnce characteristics:

Runs on the game thread

Re-queues itself via SKSE::GetTaskInterface()->AddTask

Does not spawn threads

Does not sleep

4.3 Add a busy-loop guard:

Pump must call ActorManager::Update(dt) at most once per frame

Guard must detect whether frame/time has advanced

If not advanced, skip Update but still reschedule PumpOnce

4.4 Add ActorManager::Update(float dt) stub (no-op).

4.5 Call StartPump() from existing plugin initialization paths (DataLoaded/NewGame/PostLoadGame), with a guard to prevent multiple starts.

Checkpoint E:
Build succeeds. Behavior unchanged. Pump runs safely without busy-looping.

STOP CONDITION:
If a reliable frame-advance guard cannot be implemented using RE state, stop and ask before proceeding.

Phase 5: Locate and use RE frame delta time

5.1 Identify a reliable RE-provided per-frame delta time source available in the current CommonLib/RE headers.

5.2 Implement dt acquisition:

dt must come from RE (not steady_clock, not fixed dt).

dt <= 0 or unchanged frame marker skips Update.

5.3 Optionally clamp dt conservatively for pathological spikes (loading).

5.4 Integrate dt into PumpOnce and pass into ActorManager::Update(dt).

Checkpoint F:
Build succeeds. Update(dt) is called no more than once per frame with plausible dt values.

HARD STOP:
If no reliable RE dt source exists, stop and ask before choosing any fallback.

Phase 6: Deterministic timeline runtime scaffolding (parallel, behavior preserved)

6.1 Add ActiveTimeline runtime structure to ActorManager:

Token snapshot

Actor identities

Timeline identifier

elapsedSeconds

Command scheduling state

Existing touched-node/morph tracking remains authoritative

6.2 Add StartTimelineDeterministic path:

Initializes ActiveTimeline state

Does not spawn threads

Does not replace existing StartTimeline yet

6.3 Extend ActorManager::Update(dt):

Advance elapsedSeconds

Determine which commands become due

Execute due commands instantly using existing execution paths

Do not schedule tweens yet

Checkpoint G:
Build succeeds. Deterministic path exists but is not yet authoritative.

Phase 7: Replace thread-per-command timing with deterministic Update path

7.1 Modify ActorManager::StartTimeline:

Remove per-command sleep threads

Register ActiveTimeline runtime state instead

Preserve existing cancellation semantics

7.2 Ensure CancelAndReset behavior remains identical:

Token invalidation first

ActiveTimeline entries cleared

Scales and morphs reset as before

7.3 Remove or disable old thread-per-command timing code cleanly.

Checkpoint H:
Build succeeds.

Functional check 1:

Existing INI timelines fire at correct times

FBEvent start works

PairEnd/NPCPairedStop cancels and resets

Rapid retrigger cancels previous timeline correctly

Phase 8: Central tween runner (tick-driven, no threads)

8.1 Add ActiveTween container to ActorManager (single-thread ownership).

8.2 ActiveTween fields:

Actor identity

Morph key

totalDelta

appliedSoFar

durationSeconds

elapsedSeconds

Token snapshot

8.3 When executing morph commands:

tweenSeconds <= 0: instant AddDelta (unchanged)

tweenSeconds > 0: schedule or replace ActiveTween

8.4 In ActorManager::Update(dt):

Advance ActiveTweens:

elapsedSeconds += dt

alpha = clamp(elapsed / duration)

targetApplied = totalDelta * alpha

stepDelta = targetApplied - appliedSoFar

Dispatch FBMorph::AddDelta(stepDelta)

appliedSoFar = targetApplied

Remove when complete

Drop tweens immediately on token mismatch or invalid actor

8.5 CancelAndReset:

Immediately clears relevant ActiveTweens

Token invalidation remains as safety

Checkpoint I:
Build succeeds.

Functional check 2:

Tweened morph ramps over tweenSeconds

Mid-tween cancellation resets fully

Multiple concurrent tweens work

Re-trigger during tween cancels old cleanly

Phase 9: Curve placeholder validation

9.1 Accept only linear curve.
9.2 Strict INI rejects unknown curves.
9.3 Non-strict logs and falls back to linear.

Checkpoint J:
Build succeeds. Behavior stable.

Phase 10: Parsing migration cleanup

10.1 Migrate all legacy timeline and command parsing out of AnimationEvents into FBConfig.

10.2 AnimationEvents responsibilities after migration:

Receive animation graph events

Filter FBEvent and stop events

Resolve caster/target

Request timelines from FBConfig

Call ActorManager start/cancel/reset

10.3 Remove duplicated config globals and legacy parser state from AnimationEvents.

Checkpoint K:
Build succeeds.

Final verification matrix

Instant morph commands behave exactly as before

Tweened morphs ramp correctly

Cancellation mid-tween leaves no residual state

Reset behavior unchanged

No worker threads exist for timelines or tweens

ActorManager Update(dt) is sole timing authority

Parsing lives exclusively in FBConfig

End of checklist








Authority and Scope

This document provides explicit, temporary execution instructions for the Tween Refactor task.
It is task-scoped and non-canonical, but authoritative for this refactor.

If instructions conflict, resolve in this order:

docs/architecture (once stable)

This document (YourAssignment)

docs/design_notes

This document may override defaults and workflows, but must not redefine architecture or external contracts.

Executor Role Definition

You are operating as an executor GPT.

Your responsibilities:

Implement the refactor exactly as described

Preserve existing behavior unless explicitly changed here

Keep changes scoped, readable, and reversible

Ask before making architectural changes beyond this assignment

Prefer minimal-diff refactors over rewrites

Treat existing stable systems as fragile unless instructed otherwise

You must not:

Invent new systems outside this scope

Change external contracts (INI grammar, event names, semantics)

Perform speculative or aesthetic refactors

Improve or clean up unrelated code

Introduce engine-level hooks or new update mechanisms

Project Invariants (Must Remain True)

Animations describe intent; code executes intent.

Timelines may originate from INI now and HKX annotations later.

Downstream runtime systems must not care about the source.

The animation start event is always named FBEvent.

FBEvent is authored in the paired animation clip trigger array.

Cancellation and reset semantics must remain unchanged.

All changes must be backward compatible with existing INI files.

High-Level Goal

Add optional tweening support for morph timeline commands while preserving the existing INI-driven pipeline, runtime behavior, and external contracts.

Tweening must:

Be optional

Default to current instant behavior

Distribute a command’s delta over time

Integrate cleanly with the existing ActorManager execution model

This refactor must also prepare (but not implement) future HKX timeline support.

Tween Execution Model (Authoritative Decision)

Tween stepping shall use a central tween runner thread owned by ActorManager.

This runner:

Is not an engine tick

Is not routed through SKSE update hooks

Is not frame-accurate

Ticks at a fixed cadence using sleep (for example 16–33ms)

Advances all active tweens in one place

There must NOT be:

One thread per tween

Engine update hooks

New scheduling systems

The runner must:

Be cancellable via the existing token mechanism

Exit cleanly when no tweens are active (or idle safely)

Dispatch all game-thread mutations via existing SKSE task mechanisms

Tween Semantics (Authoritative)

tweenSeconds represents the total duration over which a command’s declared delta is applied.

This means:

A morph command with value X applies exactly X total delta

Tweening controls how quickly that delta is reached

Faster tween = same result sooner

Slower tween = same result later

Implementation requirement:

Store totalDelta and appliedSoFar

Each tick applies (targetAtTime - appliedSoFar)

Never repeatedly re-base off current actor state

Sum of all steps must equal the declared delta (within float tolerance)

No absolute target morph values are introduced.

Data Model Changes (Minimal)

Extend the existing timed-command representation to include:

tweenSeconds (float, default 0.0)

tweenCurve (enum or identifier, default linear)

If tweenSeconds == 0:

Command follows the existing instant execution path

If tweenSeconds > 0:

Command is executed via the tween system

Do not:

Change command naming

Change existing fields

Add new command types

INI Parsing Changes

INI grammar must remain backward compatible.

Parsing updates:

Extend existing command parsing to optionally read tween parameters

Missing tween fields must default safely

Strict INI mode must reject malformed tween syntax

Non-strict mode must log and ignore invalid tween fields

No reformatting of existing INI files is required.

AnimationEvents Refactor Instruction

Legacy timeline parsing logic currently located in AnimationEvents shall be migrated into FBConfig.

After migration:

FBConfig is the sole owner of timeline parsing and validation

AnimationEvents acts only as an orchestration layer

AnimationEvents responsibilities:

Receive animation graph events

Filter for FBEvent and stop events

Resolve caster and target

Request timeline execution from ActorManager

Trigger cancel/reset on stop events

AnimationEvents must not:

Parse INI files

Own timeline data

Execute commands directly

Removal of AnimationEvents entirely is NOT required at this stage.

ActorManager Responsibilities (Post-Refactor)

ActorManager owns:

Timeline execution

Tween lifecycle management

Cancellation tokens

Reset behavior

Tracking of touched nodes and morphs

ActorManager must:

Route instant commands exactly as before

Route tweened commands through the central tween runner

Respect existing cancellation and reset semantics

Remain the single source of runtime truth

Future HKX Support (Stub Only)

Introduce an abstraction boundary (for example a TimelineProvider concept) such that:

INI timelines are provided via FBConfig

HKX timelines could be added later

Do NOT:

Parse HKX files

Load annotations

Change runtime behavior

Add feature flags

This is a structural preparation only.

Non-Goals (Explicit)

This refactor must NOT:

Redesign the scheduler

Introduce visibility tweening

Introduce absolute morph targets

Change event names

Change reset behavior

Change cancellation semantics

Touch unrelated legacy systems

Perform code cleanup unrelated to tweening or parsing migration

Success Criteria

The refactor is successful when:

Existing INI timelines behave identically with tweenSeconds = 0

Morph tweening works correctly over time

Cancellation mid-tween leaves no residual state

Reset behavior remains correct

AnimationEvents no longer parses timelines

FBConfig is the single parsing authority

No new engine hooks are introduced
